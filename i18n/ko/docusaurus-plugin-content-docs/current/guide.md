# **General Navigation Guide** {#d373471a11874a858fb7a21b506af60a}


This page will help you navigate the various features based on your user profile (Beginners, Bitcoiners, Web3 Users, Advanced users).


Please kindly note that this is not a 101 guide on crypto. We assume you already understand basic concepts like seed phrases, private keys, addresses and have some experience with software wallets.


# **Beginners** {#ece328d0f6c246a093cc5c122ffa4c00}


For beginners, the first and ultimate thing you should remember is to NEVER share your seed phrase to ANYONE. Some of the common tricks by scammers include:


1. 1.DM you on social media with our team member's profile to ask you to share your seed phrase or share a  website link to collect that info.
2. 2.Buy ads on social media or search engines for their phishing sites to collect your seed phrase or register similar domains expecting you to enter sensitive data.


As a beginner, feel free to follow these tutorials to easily utilize your Keystone hardware wallet with its companion app to achieve 100% air-gapping security when sending and receiving cryptocurrencies.
