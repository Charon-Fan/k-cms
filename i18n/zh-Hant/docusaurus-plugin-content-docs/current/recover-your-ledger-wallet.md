## Understanding Keystone: Basic Information {#f7b6fd4119774f13bd91df6a9a844dce}


Welcome to Keystone! This section will provide you with important information about Keystone and get you ready to start using it.


<details>
  <summary>Unleash the Power of Keystone: Decentralization & Integrated Wallets</summary>


Keystone operates as a decentralized hardware for managing cryptocurrency, presenting numerous benefits compared to conventional all-in-one solutions. It boasts improved security measures and mitigates the risk of single-point failures.


**Keystone encourages diversity in software wallet usage by offering integrations with various options (e.g. MetaMask, Core, BlockWallet, OKX, Keplr, etc.)**, thus giving users an increased level of control and flexibility over their digital assets.


In circumstances where wallet recovery becomes essential, such as when a Keystone device goes missing or is damaged, Keystone supports coin/token recovery through the respective blockchain's official or widely-used software wallets. We adhere to their primary derivation paths.


In contrast, Ledger follows the standard BIP44 derivation path, leading to differences in Keystone and Ledger addresses. Ledger has elaborated on this topic in their own article: [**Understanding Crypto Addresses and Derivation Paths**](https://blog.ledger.com/understanding-crypto-addresses-and-derivation-paths/).


Thus, the primary distinctions are our emphasis on users harnessing third-party software wallets to enrich their experience and lessen reliance, along with our use of distinct derivation paths to create accounts for certain coins/tokens.



  </details>


<details>
  <summary>Coin Support and Third-Party Wallet Integration</summary>


Keystone offers support for a diverse range of digital assets, including popular cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL, NEAR, BNB, POLYGON, APTOS, DOT, KSM, XRP, LTC, DASH, BCH, AR, ATM, and TRON. By default, Keystone displays the main-chain assets, but you can easily add and manage additional tokens through the software wallets.


To stay informed about the latest supported assets and compatible wallets, we recommend visiting the [Keystone website](https://keyst.one/supported-wallets-and-assets) for an up-to-date list.


We are also excited to announce that upcoming support for ADA is in the works. Stay tuned for further updates on this integration.
